Description: Modernized ART Simulator of Diverse Next-Generation Sequencing Reads
 High-performance simulation of realistic next-generation sequencing (NGS)
 data is a must for various algorithm development and benchmarking tasks.
 However, most existing simulators are either slow or generate data that
 does not reflect the real-world error profile of simulators. Here
 introduces `art_modern`, a modern re-implementation of the popular ART
 simulator with enhanced performance and functionality. It can be used for
 anyone who wants to simulate sequencing data for their own research, like
 benchmarking of DNA- or RNA-Seq alignment algorithms, test whether the
 RNA-Seq pipeline built by your lab performs well or perform pressure
 testing of pipelines on a cluster. This simulator would be best suited
 for GNU/Linux-based High-End Desktops (HEDTs) with multiple cores and a
 fast SSD. However, it can also work on laptops or high-performance
 clusters (HPCs) with only one node. With such simulators, the
 testing and benchmarking of NGS-related bioinformatics algorithms can be
 largely accelerated.
