# Readme for `art_modern`

Modernized ART that is parallelized and modularized using modern C++.

**WARNING** Largely under development in internal Git hosting. The Git repository on GitHub may not reflect latest status.

## Quick Start

Build the project using:

```shell
mkdir -p build_release
env -C build_release cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCEU_CM_SHOULD_ENABLE_TEST=FALSE ..
env -C build_release make
```

The project binary will be available at `build_release/art_modern`.

## Installation 

### Dependencies

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/), the building system used in our project. That further require:
  - A [CMake Generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).
    - Under GNU/Linux, using [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) or [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) is preferred.
  - Under GNU/Linux, our project further requires [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash).
- A working C and C++ compiler that supports C++ 14. Following compilers are supported:
  - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/);
  - [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/);
  - [Intel oneAPI DPCPP](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/dpcpp-cpp-compiler/get-started-guide/2024-2/overview.html).
- [Boost C++ Library](https://www.boost.org/). The modules used in this project are namely:
  - **REQUIRED** [FileSystem](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/filesystem/);
  - **REQUIRED** [Regex](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/regex/);
  - **REQUIRED** [Program Options](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/program_options/);
  - **REQUIRED** [Thread](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/thread/);
  - **REQUIRED** [Log](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/log/);
  - **OPTIONAL** [Test](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/test/): For unit testing only. Can be absent for non-developers;
  - **OPTIONAL** [Timer](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/timer/): For displaying CPU and wall-clock time at the end of the program.
- A working [HTSLib](https://www.htslib.org/).
  - To use bundled HTSLib sources, you need to have:
    - **REQUIRED** [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/);
    - **REQUIRED** [pthread](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html);
    - **OPTIONAL** [libbz2](http://www.bzip.org/);
    - **OPTIONAL** [liblzma](https://tukaani.org/xz/); 
    - **OPTIONAL** [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate);
    - See [official HTSLib documentation](https://github.com/samtools/samtools/blob/master/INSTALL) for more details.
  - To use external HTSLib, consult your system administrator.

### CMake Variables

CMake variables should be set when invoking `cmake`. For example,

```shell
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```

sets `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` to `ON`.

- `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`: Whether to build shared libraries
  - `ON` (DEFAULT): Will search for shared libraries and use dynamic linking.
  - `OFF`: Will search for static libraries and use static linking.
- `USE_HTSLIB`: Use which HTSLib implementation
  - unset (DEFAULT): Will use bundled HTSLib.
  - `hts`: Will use the HTSLib found in system.
- `CEU_CM_SHOULD_ENABLE_TEST`: Whether test should be enabled.
  - unset (DEFAULT): Depends on `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.
  - `OFF`: Will disable test.
  - `ON`: Will enable test.
- `CEU_CM_SHOULD_USE_NATIVE`: Whether to build the binaries using `-mtune=native`, if possible. This would result in faster executable but impaired portability.
  - `OFF` (DEFAULT): Will not build native executables/libraries.
  - `ON`: Will not native executables/libraries.
- [`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html): The CMake build type.
  - `Debug` (DEFAULT): For developers with debugging needs.
    - Optimization is turned off with debugging symbols and compiler warnings enabled.
    - If `CEU_CM_SHOULD_ENABLE_TEST` is unset, it will be set to `TRUE`.
  - `Release`: Optimized executables/libraries without debug symbols.
    - Optimization is turned on with compiler warnings disabled.
    - If `CEU_CM_SHOULD_ENABLE_TEST` is unset, it will be set to `FALSE`.
  - `RelWithDebInfo`: Optimized executables/libraries with debug symbols.
    - Optimization is turned on with compiler warnings disabled.
    - If `CEU_CM_SHOULD_ENABLE_TEST` is unset, it will be set to `TRUE`.

## Usage

### Mode

### Library Construction Methods

### FASTA Parsers

## Changes Compared to Official ART Implementation

Changes on software function:

- [ ] Supports 3 modes: `wgs`, `trans` and `templ`, similar to `pbsim3`.
- [ ] Supports 3 FASTA parsers: `memory`, `htslib` and `stream`.
- [X] Supports 3 library construction methods: `se`, `pe` and `mp`.
- [X] Except FASTQ, support output in SAM and BAM format through HTSLib.
- [X] Support over masking detection was dropped.
- [X] Support over sequencers except Illumina dropped.
- [X] Support over the `aln` output format was dropped.
- [X] Built-in profiles are no longer supported. User must specify path to existing profiles.

Changes on software engineering stuff:

- Build system changed to CMake.
- All C++ code were re-implemented in C++14 with radical removal of duplicated or unused code.
- Random generator was changed from GNU Science Library (GSL) to Boost or C++ standard library.
- Logging re-implemented using Boost.
- Multithreading support implemented using Boost.
- Largely eliminated POSIX-only routines by Boost.
- Argument parser implemented in Boost.

## TODO

- Refactor output-related argument parser to `OutputDispatcher`.
- Design and implement a job scheduling system using `boost::lockfree` and `boost::signal2`.
- Make it faster.
- Update the HTSLib CMake routine for setting macros like `HAVE_LIBBZ2` correct.
- Support running under Microsoft Windows.

- Support [Illumina Complete Long Read](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-brand/complete-long-reads-portfolio.html)?
- Support MAF output format?

## FAQ

### How to split produced pair-end/mate-pair sequencing results to 2 files?

This can be done through [`seqtk`](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). For example, to split `tmp/test_small_pe/NC_001416.1.fq`:

```shell
# Read 1
seqtk seq tmp/test_small_pe/NC_001416.1.fq -1 > tmp/test_small_pe/NC_001416.1_1.fq
# Read 2
seqtk seq tmp/test_small_pe/NC_001416.1.fq -2 > tmp/test_small_pe/NC_001416.1_2.fq
```
