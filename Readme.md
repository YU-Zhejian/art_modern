# Readme for `art_modern`

Modernized ART that is parallelized and modularized using modern C++.

## Quick Start

## Installation 

### Dependencies

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
- A working C and C++ compiler that supports C++ 14. Following compilers are supported:
  - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/);
  - [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/);
  - [Intel oneAPI DPCPP](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/dpcpp-cpp-compiler/get-started-guide/2024-2/overview.html).
- [Boost C++ Library](https://www.boost.org/). Required modules are namely:
  - [FileSystem](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/filesystem/);
  - [Regex](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/regex/);
  - [Timer](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/timer/);
  - [Program Options](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/program_options/);
  - [Thread](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/thread/);
  - [Log](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/log/);
  - [Test](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/test/).
- A working [HTSLib](https://www.htslib.org/).
  - To use bundled HTSLib sources, you need to have:
    - **REQUIRED** [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/);
    - **REQUIRED** [pthread](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html);
    - **OPTIONAL** [libbz2](http://www.bzip.org/);
    - **OPTIONAL** [liblzma](https://tukaani.org/xz/); 
    - **OPTIONAL** [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate);
    - See [official HTSLib documentation](https://github.com/samtools/samtools/blob/master/INSTALL) for more details.
  - To use external HTSLib, consult your system administrator.

### Library Construction Methods

### FASTA Parsers

## Changes Compared to Official ART Implementation

Changes on software function:

-[ ] Supports 3 modes: `wgs`, `trans` and `templ`, similar to `pbsim3`.
-[ ] Supports 3 FASTA parsers: `memory`, `htslib` and `stream`.
-[X] Supports 3 library construction methods: `se`, `pe` and `mp`.
-[ ] Except FASTQ, support output in SAM and BAM format through HTSLib.
-[X] Support over masking detection was dropped.
-[X] Support over sequencers except Illumina dropped.
-[X] Support over the `aln` output format was dropped.
-[X] Built-in profiles are no longer supported. User must specify path to existing profiles.

Changes on software engineering stuff:

- Build system changed to CMake.
- All C++ code were re-implemented in C++14 with radical removal of duplicated or unused code.
- Random generator was changed from GNU Science Library (GSL) to Boost or C++ standard library.
- Logging re-implemented using Boost.
- Multithreading support implemented using Boost.
- Largely eliminated POSIX-only routines by Boost.
- Argument parser implemented in Boost.

## TODO

- Implement support over `sam` and `bam` output using `htslib`.
- Make it faster.
- Update the HTSLib CMake routine for setting macros like `HAVE_LIBBZ2` correct.
