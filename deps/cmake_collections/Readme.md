#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX(VERSION, [ext|noext], [mandatory|optional])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Check for baseline language coverage in the compiler for the specified
#   version of the C++ standard.  If necessary, add switches to CXX and
#   CXXCPP to enable support.  VERSION may be '11', '14', '17', '20', or
#   '23' for the respective C++ standard version.
#
#   The second argument, if specified, indicates whether you insist on an
#   extended mode (e.g. -std=gnu++11) or a strict conformance mode (e.g.
#   -std=c++11).  If neither is specified, you get whatever works, with
#   preference for no added switch, and then for an extended mode.
#
#   The third argument, if specified 'mandatory' or if left unspecified,
#   indicates that baseline support for the specified C++ standard is
#   required and that the macro should error out if no mode with that
#   support is found.  If specified 'optional', then configuration proceeds
#   regardless, after defining HAVE_CXX${VERSION} if and only if a
#   supporting mode is found.
